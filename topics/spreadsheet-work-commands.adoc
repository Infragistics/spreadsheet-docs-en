== Commands Introduction

=== Commands summary

The {SpreadsheetName} control provides a lot of commands for activating different features by instantiating the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xamspreadsheet.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.primitives.spreadsheetcommandsource_members.html[SpreadsheetCommandSource] type. You can find the full list of commands in the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xamspreadsheet.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.spreadsheetcommandtype.html[SpreadsheetCommandType] enumeration.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Some of the commands (like Clipboard commands or Undo/Redo commands) are mapped to the routed commands in the link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.input.applicationcommands(v=vs.110).aspx[ApplicationCommands] class, and also some editing commands (like alignments or text styling) are mapped to the routed commands in the link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.documents.editingcommands(v=vs.110).aspx[EditingCommands] class.
