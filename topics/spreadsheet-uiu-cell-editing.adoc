== Cell Editing

=== Cell editing summary

The user has the ability to edit the value of an {SpreadsheetName} active cell. The cell value can be edited when the cell is in edit mode. The control supports several ways for entering edit mode depending of the input device which are described further in this topic. After editing a cell value and confirming the new input the control may automatically navigate the active cell to an adjacent cell.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
If the user has more than one worksheet selected and edits a cell’s content, all cells with the same address in all other selected worksheets will get the same cell content.
