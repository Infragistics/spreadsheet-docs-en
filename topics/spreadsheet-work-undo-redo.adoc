== Undo and Redo Configuration Summary

=== Undo and Redo configuration summary

The {SpreadsheetName} control uses the link:undo-redo-framework.html[Infragistics Undo/Redo Framework] to provide robust undo and redo support for the changes made by the user. The control tracks all changes made to the associated workbook and populates the  pick:[xaml=" link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager.html[UndoManager]"]  pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}.html[Undo]"] .

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Each {SpreadsheetName} control uses its own `UndoManager` instance. You can also use the same `UndoManager` across multiple {SpreadsheetName} instances by setting this instance to the link:{SpreadsheetLink}.{SpreadsheetName}~undomanager.html[UndoManager] property.
====

"Undo" and "Redo" operations are triggered via the following:

* The user presses a specific key combination while the {SpreadsheetName} has focus. For example, Ctrl + Z triggers an  _Undo_   operation while Ctrl + Y triggers a  _Redo_   operation.
* Invoking the  *Undo*  and  *Redo*   pick:[wpf,sl,xaml="commands"]  pick:[win-forms="actions"]  (see code snippets below)
* Calling the following  pick:[win-forms="Manager"]  pick:[xaml="methods"] 

ifdef::xaml[]
** {SpreadsheetName} link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~undo.html[.UndoManager.Undo]

endif::xaml[]

ifdef::win-forms[]
** {SpreadsheetName} link:{SpreadsheetLink}.{SpreadsheetName}~undomanager.html[.UndoManager]

== Enable or Disable Undo and Redo Support

[[_Hlk368069110]]

=== Overview

You can enable or disable the undo/redo support of the control using the `IsUndoEnabled` property.

=== Property settings

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Enable undo operation on a specific {SpreadsheetName} instance.
|`IsUndoEnabled`
|`true`

|Disable undo operation on a specific {SpreadsheetName} instance.
|`IsUndoEnabled`
|`false`

|====

[[_Ref391543494]]
== Invoke Undo Operation  pick:[wpf,sl,xaml="Using Command"]

=== Overview

The redo operation incrementally backs out the changes inserted by the undo operation, pops the undo operation record off the redo history stack and adds it to the top of the undo history stack.

=== Property settings

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Instantiate the following command source:|And set the following properties:

|Perform the Undo operation on a specific {SpreadsheetName} instance.
|`SpreadsheetCommandSource`
|`EventName` 

`CommandType`

|====

=== Method settings

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Perform the following method:|Set the desired enumerated value:

|Perform the Undo operation on a specific {SpreadsheetName} instance.
|`PerformAction`
|`UltraSpreadsheetAction.Undo`

|====

=== Example

ifdef::xaml[]

pick:[xaml="*In XAML:*"]

ifdef::xaml[]
----
<Button Content="Undo" 
    ig:Commanding.CommandTarget="{Binding ElementName=xamSpreadsheet1}">
    <ig:Commanding.Command>
