== When Validation Occurs

=== Summary

The {SpreadsheetName}’s data validation occurs when a user performed cell editing is done. If multiple cells are affected (for example when confirming editing with `Ctrl`+`Enter`) only the active cell will be validated.

If you change the value of a cell as a result of other operations (for example selecting cell(s) and pressing `Delete` or pasting values) no validation will be performed.

[[_Ref421018135]]
== Data Validation Event

The control supports a data validation-related event which is raised on cells which have validation rule assigned and when the user confirms a new input value which does not pass the validation. In the event arguments object of the event handler you have access to the edited cell and its validation rule. You can also implement your own logic which determines what action to be taken (accept, revert, stay in edit mode and show prompt) by the control.

=== Settings

The following table maps the desired task with the property from that manage it.

|Task|Use this property/event:|And

|Attach data validation event handler

|Attach an event handler to it

|Obtain or set the control’s next action
| link:{SpreadsheetLink}.spreadsheeteditmodevalidationerroreventargs~action.html[Action]
|Read or set its value of type link:{SpreadsheetLink}.spreadsheeteditmodevalidationerroreventargs_members.html[SpreadsheetEditModeValidationErrorEventArgs]

|====

.Note
[NOTE]
====
You can use the link:{SpreadsheetLink}.spreadsheeteditmodevalidationerroreventargs~canstayineditmode.html[CanStayInEditMode] property of the event arguments to check if the cell is currently allowed to stay in editing mode.
====

=== Example

The following code snippet demonstrates adding of a data validation event handler. The logic of this handler just checks if the new value can be parsed as integer and accepts the change:

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Me.{SpreadsheetName}1.EditModeValidationError += EditModeValidationError_Handler
Public Sub EditModeValidationError_Handler(sender As Object, _
            e As SpreadsheetEditModeValidationErrorEventArgs)
    Dim obj = Me.{SpreadsheetName}1.ActiveWorksheet.Rows(e.Cell.Row).Cells(e.Cell.Column).Value
    Dim number As Integer
    If Integer.TryParse(obj.ToString(), number) Then
        e.Action = SpreadsheetEditModeValidationErrorAction.AcceptChange
    Else
        e.Action = SpreadsheetEditModeValidationErrorAction.StayInEditMode
    End If
End Sub
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
this.{SpreadsheetName}1.EditModeValidationError += {SpreadsheetName}_EditModeValidationError;
void {SpreadsheetName}1_EditModeValidationError(object sender, SpreadsheetEditModeValidationErrorEventArgs e)
       {
           var obj = this.{SpreadsheetName}1.ActiveWorksheet.Rows[e.Cell.Row].Cells[e.Cell.Column].Value;
           int number;
           if (int.TryParse(obj.ToString(), out number))
           {
               e.Action = SpreadsheetEditModeValidationErrorAction.AcceptChange;
           }
           else
           {
               e.Action = SpreadsheetEditModeValidationErrorAction.StayInEditMode;
           }
       }

== Invalid Data Circles

=== Summary

The {SpreadsheetName} control supports a visual notification option which draws a circle around each cell which has a validation rule set and its value does not pass the data validation.

The following screenshot shows an invalid value circle around one of the control’s cells:

image::images/xamSpreadsheet_val1.png[]

=== Example

The following code snippet shows how to invoke the command which shows the invalid data circles:

ifdef::xaml[]

*In XAML:*

ifdef::xaml[]
----
<Button
    Content="Show Validation Circles"
    ig:Commanding.CommandTarget="{Binding ElementName=xamSpreadsheet1}">
    <ig:Commanding.Command>
        <igPrim:SpreadsheetCommandSource
            EventName="Click"
            CommandType="CircleInvalidData" />
    </ig:Commanding.Command>
</Button>
<ig:XamSpreadsheet x:Name="xamSpreadsheet1" />
----
endif::xaml[]

endif::xaml[]

ifdef::win-forms[]


pick:[win-forms="*In C#:*"]
----
private void ultraButton1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
 {
   ultraSpreadsheet1.PerformAction(UltraSpreadsheetAction.CircleInvalidData);
 }
----

endif::win-forms[]

pick:[win-forms="*In VB:*"]

ifdef::win-forms[]
----
Private Sub ultraButton1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
 ultraSpreadsheet1.PerformAction(UltraSpreadsheetAction.CircleInvalidData)
End Sub
----
endif::win-forms[]

The following code snippet shows how to invoke the command which hides the invalid data circles:

pick:[win-forms="*C#*"]

ifdef::win-forms[]
----
private void ultraButton1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
 {
   ultraSpreadsheet1.PerformAction(UltraSpreadsheetAction.ClearValidationCircles);
 }
----
endif::win-forms[]

pick:[win-forms="*In VB:*"]
ifdef::win-forms[]
----
Private Sub ultraButton1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
 ultraSpreadsheet1.PerformAction(UltraSpreadsheetAction.ClearValidationCircles)
End Sub
----
endif::win-forms[]

ifdef::xaml[]

*In XAML:*


----
<Button
    Content="Clear Validation Circles"
    ig:Commanding.CommandTarget="{Binding ElementName=xamSpreadsheet1}">
    <ig:Commanding.Command>
        <igPrim:SpreadsheetCommandSource
            EventName="Click"
            CommandType="ClearValidationCircles" />
    </ig:Commanding.Command>
</Button>
<ig:XamSpreadsheet x:Name="xamSpreadsheet1" />
----


endif::xaml[]
