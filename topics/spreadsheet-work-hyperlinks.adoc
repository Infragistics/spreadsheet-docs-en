== Hyperlinks Types

=== Hyperlinks types summary

The link:{SpreadsheetLink}.{SpreadsheetName}.html[ _{SpreadsheetName}'s_  ] control supports two type of hyperlinks:

==== Worksheet Hyperlinks

These hyperlinks are created by instantiating the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel{ApiVersion}{ApiProp}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheethyperlink_members.html[WorksheetHyperlink] class and adding the newly created object to the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel{ApiVersion}{ApiProp}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheet.html[Worksheet]'s link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel{ApiVersion}{ApiProp}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheet~hyperlinks.html[Hyperlinks] collection. These links may span over a single cell or multiple cells range. For more information about creating and configuring such hyperlinks look at the  pick:[xaml=" link:igexcelengine-addinghyperlinktoworksheet.html[Adding a Hyperlink to a Worksheet]"]  pick:[win-forms=" link:excelengine-adding-a-hyperlink-to-a-cell-in-an-excel-file.html[Adding a Hyperlink to a Worksheet]"]  topic

==== Formula Hyperlinks

These hyperlinks are created by entering a "HYPERLINK" function in a worksheet’s cell and they occupy only the cell in which they are defined. The following formula example will add a formula hyperlink to the Infragistics website:

`=HYPERLINK("http://www.infragistics.com", "Infragistics")`

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The formula hyperlinks cannot have custom tooltips. Only the default tooltip is shown for them.
====

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The "followed" state of the worksheet hyperlinks is retained between undo and redo operations for worksheet hyperlinks, but not for the formula hyperlinks.
====

== Hyperlinks Command Support

=== Command support

The following is a list of the commands associated with hyperlinks with a brief description:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Command|Details

| *OpenHyperlink* 
|This command will only be enabled when a single cell (or a single merged cell) is selected and that cell has a hyperlink (either a worksheet hyperlink or a formula hyperlink). The command will open/follow the selected cell’s hyperlink target.

| *RemoveHyperlinks* 
|This command will remove one or more hyperlinks that are either fully contained within the current selection or that fully contain the selection. This is enabled if there are one or more worksheet hyperlinks that may be removed based on the selection. 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

This command is not able to remove formula hyperlink(s) and is not enabled when the selection contains only formula hyperlink(s). 

====

| *ClearHyperlinks* 
|This command is almost identical to *RemoveHyperlinks* except that when removing the hyperlinks the formatting of the cell will be preserved. 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

If the current selection intersects with but does not contain a merged cell, the command will not be allowed.

== Hyperlinks Event

=== Event summary

The {SpreadsheetName} control supports one cancelable hyperlinks-related event - link:{SpreadsheetLink}.{SpreadsheetName}{ApiProp}hyperlinkexecuting_ev.html[HyperlinkExecuting] which is fired prior to opening the hyperlink.

In the event handler you have the abilities to:

* Cancel the event, which will prevent the target to be opened and the hyperlink to become followed
* Set or obtain the working directory when the hyperlink is targeting a file (so that you can specify file name only in the hyperlink's target)
* Modify the hyperlink's properties
