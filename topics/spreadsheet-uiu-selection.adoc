== Introduction

=== Selection summary

The {SpreadsheetName} control supports the following selection modes: *Normal* 

In this mode new selection range is created each time the user is dragging the mouse or navigating via the keyboard and replaces any existing selection. New selection ranges may be added via the mouse while holding the Ctrl key. *ExtendedSelection* 

The selection range is only one and it is enclosed between the active cell and the cell selected by the mouse or navigating the keyboard. The user may use the mouse while holding the Ctrl key to move the active cell. *AddToSelection* 

New cell ranges are added without the need of holding the Control key. The user may click on cell(s) to add it (them) to the current selection.

The following screenshot shows the {SpreadsheetName} control in normal selection mode with three selection ranges. The first two ranges are on the 2nd and 4th row. The 3rd selection range occupies columns E and F and rows 7 through 9 and has the active cell at address E7.
