== Adding {SpreadsheetName} to Your Page

=== Introduction

The procedure explains step by step the operations necessary for adding the {SpreadsheetName} to your page.

=== Overview

Following is a conceptual overview of the process:

*1. Add assembly references*

*2. Add namespaces*

*3. Create {SpreadsheetName}*

*4. Create content (alternative)*

*5. Load content (alternative)*

*6. Bind/set workbook to the {SpreadsheetName}*

=== Steps

The following steps demonstrate how to add the {SpreadsheetName} to your page.

=== 1. Add assembly references

Add the following assembly references in your project:

*{ApiPlatform}{ApiVersion}dll*

*{ApiPlatform}Undo{ApiVersion}.dll*

*{ApiPlatform}Documents.Core{ApiVersion}.dll*

*{ApiPlatform}Documents.Excel{ApiVersion}.dll*

pick:[xaml="*{ApiPlatform}Controls.Menus.XamMenu{ApiVersion}.dll*"]

pick:[xaml="*{ApiPlatform}Controls.Grids.{SpreadsheetName}{ApiVersion}.dll*"]

pick:[win-forms="*{ApiPlatform}Win.{SpreadsheetName}{ApiVersion}.dll*"]

=== 2. Add namespaces

Add the following namespaces:

pick:[xaml="*In XAML:*"]

ifdef::xaml[]
----
xmlns:ig="http://schemas.infragistics.com/xaml"
----
endif::xaml[]

*In C#:*

ifdef::xaml[]
----
using Infragistics.Controls.Editors; 
using Infragistics.Documents.Excel;
----
endif::xaml[]

ifdef::win-forms[]
---- 
using Infragistics.Documents.Excel;
using Infragistics.Win;
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinSpreadsheet;
----
endif::win-forms[]

*In Visual Basic:*

ifdef::xaml[]
----
Imports Infragistics.Controls.Editors 
Imports Infragistics.Documents.Excel
----
endif::xaml[]

ifdef::win-forms[]
---- 
Imports Infragistics.Documents.Excel
Imports Infragistics.Win
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinSpreadsheet
----
endif::win-forms[]

=== 3. Create {SpreadsheetName}

Create and put the {SpreadsheetName} on your page:

pick:[xaml="*In XAML:*"]

ifdef::xaml[]
----
<ig:XamSpreadsheet x:Name="xamSpreadsheet1">
</ig:XamSpreadsheet>
----
endif::xaml[]

*In C#:*

[source,xaml]
----
{SpreadsheetName} spreadsheet1 = new {SpreadsheetName}();
----

*In VB:*

[source,xaml]
----
Dim spreadsheet1 As New {SpreadsheetName}()
----

=== 4. Create content (alternative)

Create a workbook, naming it "wb1" and add content in it as described in the  pick:[xaml=" link:igexcelengine-creating-a-workbook.html[Creating a Workbook (Infragistics Excel Engine)]"]  pick:[win-forms=" link:excelengine-create-a-workbook.html[Creating a Workbook (Infragistics Excel Engine)]"]  topic.

.Note
